        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>My name is Thomas Anthony Cot&eacute;. Being born and raised in beautiful California has allowed me the privilege to enjoy one of the most fantastic climates and cultures the word has to offer. I currently live in the Silicon Valley and utilize my professional experiences in broadcasting and multimedia to manage the event technology operations for the prestigious <a href="http://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/cordevalle-northern-california/interests/business" />Rosewood CordeValle Resort</a> in San Martin. I've managed and produced dozens of corporate meetings for top industry firms from around the globe.</p>
        
        <p>I'm also a huge web design and programming enthusiast and hope to make this the cornerstone of my livelihood someday soon. In fact, I designed and programmed this entire site! Please reach out to me with any production inquiries or front-end development opportunities.</p>
    
        <h6>Thank you.</h6>

        <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
        <p>I believe in working hard and being honest. Finding passion for something should be a natural process and I feel truly passionate about web engineering and the journey towards greater knowledge in the field. It's a fascinating way to make a living and I keep finding so many surprising examples of other programmer’s incredible ingenuity; I love it! Its given me a real sense of my own self, and steered me towards broader horizons where I'm challenged on a daily basis.</p>
        
        <p>I think many will agree that web technology is still very young and that it's quickly evolving. The most attractive element of programming is the strong emphasis placed on free resources for learning. I hope the barriers-to-entry continue to remain low as this approach always yields the strongest talent. I appreciate the truly objective nature of programming because it creates a sort of measuring stick by which an individual’s skills can be accurately measured.</p>
        
        <p>In closing, I merely want to express my excitement and hope for the future of the web. There are still so many avenues to explore and I'm looking forward to building deeper and stronger knowledge of how to bring the internet to life. The Silicon Valley is ground zero, where simple ideas turn into products that are expedited to the world's population, faster and more efficiently than any other location on earth. I'm not completely sure what my role will be in all of it, but having the opportunity to find out means so much.</p>
